# NXT_Swerve Master Branch
We are currently working on building on Swerve test robot out of Lego NXT. Code will be posted here in the master branch. We are using LabView 2015 with the 2015 NXT plugin. If you would like us to export the LabView code for a previous version, please submit an Issue and we will do out best.

Lego Designer files are in the ldd branch. Pictures will be placed in the gh-pages branch as we get to it.
